# Contributing

As long as an addition meets these two simple criteria, I'll likely merge it:

1.  **fit in:** Stick to the "Ghost UI" aesthetic—Segoe UI Light font, white/grey colors, and low opacity (alpha around 150).
2.  **Save the Battery:** don't hog resources. Use `UpdateDivider` or high `Update` intervals so the skin stays silent when nothing is happening.

## How to
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch.
3. Submit a Pull Request (PR). I'll review it and merge it as soon as I can!
